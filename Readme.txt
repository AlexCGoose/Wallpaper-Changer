SETUP:
1. Add wallpapers to the Wallpapers folder, numbered sequentially (i.e. 100 wallpapers numbered 1 to 100)
    - DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER FILES TO THIS FOLDER
    - 4 wallpapers have been added to demonstrate, made by Matt Vince at https://www.mattvince.com/
2. Add your latitude, longitude, the index values of the desired sunrise and sunset wallpaper, the index of the target monitor, and the wallpaper file type to config.json
    - Experimentation may be required to figure out the index of the target monitor, each monitor connected to a PC has an index from 1 to the number of monitors
4. Create a shortcut of wallpaper-changer.pyw and move it to %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
5. Run the file from the Startup folder or restart your computer
